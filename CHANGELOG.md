## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.0] - 2020-07-05
### Changed
- Disable caching by default since people are often confused by this default setting. You can enable caching by following what is explained in the README.
- Increase maximum timeout to 15s from 3s.

## [1.1.0] - 2019-10-27
### Changed
- Decrease the default cache period to 10min from 24h. 
This is to better handle use cases that require fresh [security data](https://ipregistry.co/docs/proxy-tor-threat-detection#content). 
Indeed, such data is updated multiple times each hour. 
You can still configure the cache period to a higher value:
